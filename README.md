How I Built the Website
This portfolio website was built from scratch using HTML and CSS. The key design focus was to create a clean and professional appearance, while making the site engaging through animations. Each section contains a specific function:

Home: Highlights my introduction as a CSE student and developer.
Projects: Showcases my web development and coding projects, with links to GitHub repositories.
Skills: Lists my technical abilities, including programming languages and frameworks.
Contact: Provides my email, phone, and Facebook details for easy communication.
Future Plans
In the future, I plan to:

Add new features like a blog or a section to share my research.
Implement a backend for a contact form to receive inquiries directly.
Continuously update the projects section with my latest work.
